- Define the Employee type: Create a type Employee with properties id (number), name (string), and department (string).

- Define the Manager type: Create a type Manager with properties id (number), name (string), and employees (an array of Employee).

- Create a Union Type: Define a type Staff that is a union of Employee and Manager.

- Create the printStaffDetails function: This function should accept a parameter of type Staff. Inside the function, use a type guard to check if the 'employees' property exists in the passed object. If it does, print a message indicating that the person is a manager and the number of employees they manage. If it doesn't, print a message indicating that the person is an employee and the department they belong to.

- Create Employee and Manager objects: Create two Employee objects. One named alice and second named steve. Also create a Manager object named bob who manages alice and steve.

- Test the function: Call the printStaffDetails function with alice and bob as arguments and verify the output.
